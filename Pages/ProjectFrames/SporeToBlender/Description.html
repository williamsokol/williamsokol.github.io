      This is a tutorial on exporting spore creatures.
      I'm using this in another unfinished project called 
      <a href="https://github.com/williamsokol/SildoGame" target="_blank">Sildo Game</a 
      I go indepth on shaders, and retargeting animations, and learned about it my self for this tutorial.
