      <p><br>This game is a fun little mix between Asteroids and Galaga. Itâ€™s also got a boss battle that's pretty tough. You shoot enemy ships and fight stronger ones as you go for long as possible<br></p>
      <p>This game was made in 1 week from Jan 25 to Jan 31, 2022 as a challenge and there's a decent amount of polish that considered.

      <p>There are arrow key&nbsp;controls as well but I think most people would try that without checking.&nbsp;</p>
