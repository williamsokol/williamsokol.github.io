This is a robot running off of an esp-cam and is being controlled over a website. It uses websockets to run at a decent speed over internet and stream video to the site as well.

The camera is a bit wobbly but you really can't expect much better when it is being held by its wires. Hope to polish design up soon :)

If you are looking for code I have a public GitHub repository here:
